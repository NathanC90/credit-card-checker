# credit-card-checker

Another Javascript project from Codecademy challenge. In this challenged, we are introduced [Luhn algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm#Description) which is used to check if a credit card number is valid.

We are asked to create 3 functions regarding the credit card checker as follows:

1. ValidateCred() to check if the card number is valid.
2. findInvalidCards() to loop through the card numbers and return invalid cards.
3. idInvalidCardCompanies() to identify which card company issued the faulty numbers.
